#Â CRUD

CRUD describes the four basic functions of persistent storage, usually referred to in relation to interacting with database interactions. CRUD is an acronym of four main actions:

**C** create  
**R** Read (retrieve)  
**U** Update (modify)  
**D** Delete (destroy)

Most applications involve CRUD functionality of some kind. CRUD is closely tied with [REST](https://github.com/iammatthewward/notes/blob/master/principles/REST.md), and represents the end point in a data structure of a REST interaction.
