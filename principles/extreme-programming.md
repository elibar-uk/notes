# Extreme Programming

Extreme programming is a software development methodology, aimed at creating software with a stress on customer satisfaction. Rather than delivering everything in one go at a date far in the future, XP is designed to deliver features as they are needed and allows developers to respond to changes in requirements. XP has emphasis on teamwork: managers, customers, and developers are all equal partners in a team.

## XP Values
### Simplicity
* Do what is needed and no more.
* Make no assumptions on requirements.
* Take small simple steps towards a goal.

### Communication
* Everyone is part of the same team.
* Communicate face to face daily.
* Work together on all aspects of a project.

### Feedback
* Demonstrate software early and often, and respond to feedback.
* Adapt process to the project, not the other way around.
* Deliver working software at each iteration.

### Respect
* Everyone is valued as a team member, with equal respect.
* Everyone contributes value to a team.
* Developers and customers respect each others expertise.

### Courage
* Be truthful about progress and issues, and be upfront about deadline changes.
* Do not document excuses for failure - plan to succeed.
* No one works alone, and so we don't fear anything.

## XP Rules
### Planning
* Write users stories.
* Release planning creates the release schedule.
* Releases should be small and frequent.
* The project is divided into iterations.
* Each iteration is started with iteration planning.

### Managing
* The team should have a dedicated open work space.
* Have a sustainable pace of work.
* Each day starts with a stand-up.
* Measure the project velocity by adding up the estimates of user stories that were finished during the iteration.
* Promote knowledge and skills sharing by moving people around.
* When the XP process breaks - fix it.

### Designing
* Design with simplicity.
* Choose a metaphor for your system: a system of names for your objects that everyone can relate to without specific knowledge about the system.
* Use CRC cards (Class, Responsibilities, and Collaboration) to design the system as a team, allow the whole team to contribute to the design.
* Solve difficult problems with spikes (then throw the spike away and redo it with testing!).
* Do not add functionality early, only functionality needed now.
* Always be refactoring.

### Coding
* The customer is always available.
* Write code to consistent agreed standards.
* Always begin with a unit test.
* Pair on all production code.
* Code is only integrated by one pair at a time.
* Integrate often.
* Collective ownership: any developer can change any code to add functionality.

### Testing
* All code must have unit tests.
* No code is released without passing unit tests.
* Tests are created for bugs that are found.
* Regularly run acceptance tests from user stories.
