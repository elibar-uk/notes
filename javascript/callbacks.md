Angular, async and Callbacks



The flow on control is how a program executes.
The skill we’re learning is: how to read like the interpreter
Code is both human understandable and machine understandable
Reading like a machine is an important skill - build a model to work out what tis happening at each stage in the program

callbacks don’t get immediately executed
they’re something that happens later -  call back
but they can be evaluated in synchronous code and run asynchronously    

once javascript has finished running, it’s not done - it sits there, waiting for events and then runs the callback code

your first protractor test should always be “hello world”

use console.log(1) with numbers to see what is running when in your code

errors aren’t thrown until the callback is run

a callback is a function that gets called later

callbacks can be saved as variables and then called - cool
